# PHP Parallel Downloader (Multi Connection Downloader)

The `ParallelDownloader` class is designed to download large files using parallel connections in PHP. This class enables the simultaneous download of different parts of a file and then combines the downloaded parts into a complete file.

## Features

- **Parallel Downloading**: Ability to download multiple parts of a file simultaneously.
- **Customizability**: Ability to configure the number of connections and timeout for the download.
- **Error Handling**: Retry mechanism for downloading if an error occurs.

## Usage

To use this class, first create an instance of `ParallelDownloader` with the desired file URL and the save path. Then, by calling the `start` method, the download process begins.

```php
$url = 'https://download-url'; // Replace with the actual file URL
$path = 'file-path.zip'; // Replace with the actual save path
$downloader = new ParallelDownloader($url, $path);
$downloader->start();
```

## Installation and Setup

This class does not require the installation of any specific dependencies and relies solely on PHP's internal capabilities and cURL.
